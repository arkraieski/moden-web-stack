# A Modern Web Development Stack

- Pinecone vector database
- React JS
- OpenAI API
- Next JS

---

## Pinecone vector database

- A cloud-native vector database that makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications
- Developer-friendly, fully managed, and easily scalable without infrastructure hassles
- Vector search is useful for semantic search, recommendations, anomaly detection, and other applications that rely on relevant information retrieval

---

## React JS

- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces out of individual pieces called components
- React lets you create reusable UI components and combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps
- React is used to build single-page applications and can be added to your existing HTML page
- Learn more at [https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/)

---

## OpenAI API

- An API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI
- It can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images
- You can use the API to access pre-trained models or fine-tune your own custom models
- Learn more at [https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)

---

## Next JS

- A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications
- Next JS provides features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, code splitting, and dynamic routing
- Next JS also allows you to use React Context for state management across your application
- Learn more at [https://nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/)
